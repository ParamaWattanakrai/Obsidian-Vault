Is a mathematical expression consisting of indeterminates and coefficients.
A polynomial in a single indeterminate can always be written in the form
$$
\begin{flalign}
P(x)=\sum_{k=0}^na_kx^k=a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\cdots+a_2x^2+a_1x+a_0&&
\end{flalign}
$$
The general expression of a polynomial in multiple indeterminates is
$$
\begin{flalign}
P(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_k)=\sum_{i_1}^\infty\sum_{i_2}^\infty\cdots\sum_{k}^\infty a_{i_1,i_2,\ldots,k}x_1^{i_1}x_2^{i_2}\cdots x_k^k&&
\end{flalign}
$$
Notes: The upper limit of summations are infinite since we do not know the degree of the polynomial in advance. And beyond a certain point the terms will vanish with $a_{i_1,i_2,\ldots,k}=0$.
