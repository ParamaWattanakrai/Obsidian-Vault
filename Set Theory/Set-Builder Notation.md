Is a mathematical notation for describing a set using predicate.
$$
\begin{flalign}
\{x|\Phi(x)\}&&
\end{flalign}
$$
$$
\begin{flalign}
\{x:\Phi(x)\}&&
\end{flalign}
$$
The | (or :) can be read as "such that", "for which", or "with the property that".

Example:
$$
\begin{flalign}
P=\{p|p\text{ is prime}\}&&
\end{flalign}
$$
"p such that p is prime."

It's good practice to declare what set you're starting with.
$$
\begin{flalign}
P=\{p\in\mathbb{N}|p<5\}&&
\end{flalign}
$$
"p in the natural numbers such that p is less than 5."
