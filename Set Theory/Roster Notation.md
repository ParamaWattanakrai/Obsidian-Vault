A set can be described directly by enumerating all of its elements between curly brackets.
$\{1,2,3\}$ is a set containing three numbers 1, 2, 3 and nothing else.
$\{1,2,3\}=\{2,3,1\}$ because what matters in a set is what elements it contains and not the order.

You can also name the set.
$A=\{1,2,3\}$ 

When it is desired to denote a set that contains elements from a regular sequence, an ellipsis notation may be employed.
$\{1,2,3,\ldots,100\}$ is the set of integers between 1 and 100 inclusive.
$\{1,2,3,\ldots\}$ is the set of natural numbers.
$\{\ldots,-2,-1,0,1,2,\ldots\}$ is the set of all integers.
