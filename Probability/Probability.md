Probability concerns events and numerical descriptions of how likely they are to occur. The probability of an event is a number between 0 and 1; the larger the probability, the more likely an event is to occur.

$$
\begin{flalign}
P(E)=\frac{n(E)}{n(S)}&&
\end{flalign}
$$
$$
\begin{flalign}
0\le P \le 1&&
\end{flalign}
